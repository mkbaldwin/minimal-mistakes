Last weekend I attended the 2016 CodeStock conference in Knoxville, TN. This was
my first time attending the event after a few years of considering going. With
close to 1,000 attendees and sessions spread out over two days the conference
was large enough to have a diverse set of speakers, but yet still feel small
enough that the speakers are very approachable.

The keynote was by [Cory House](https://www.twitter.com/housecor), and was about
the technology adoption curve. He divided people, and technologies, up into
three categories: early adopter, mainstream, and strategic laggard. Obviously
most of the people into the room fit into the mainstream category (Java, .NET,
etc). There weren't many people using the latest bleeding edge stuff (at least
not for production) or using ancient technologies. He pointed out advantages of
being in different places. I thought it was interesting that he pointed out that
specializing in an older technology like COBOL had a finish line. A point where
you could say that you are done learning it and know the whole thing since it
isn't changing anymore. As opposed to the mainstream where you are running on a
proprietary treadmill trying to keep up.

I went to a talk called "Take Back Project Sanity: The Kanban Journey" by
[David Neal](https://www.twitter.com/reverentgeek). Which was really good for a
talk on project management. He pointed out a lot of benefits of the Kanban
approach for visualizing your workflow. The big takeaway from it I had was that
you don't have to change your process to get started. You simply have your
Kanban boards reflect what you already are doing. I also heard him talk in a
different session about building desktop applications with Electron. Which if
you are not familiar with it, is the framework developed by GitHub for their
text editor Atom. So, it is essentially JavaScript (Node.js) and HTML/CSS. I've
not used it, but it looks pretty nice for building cross platform apps.

Overall I enjoyed the experience at CodeStock and look forward to attending,
and maybe even presenting, in 2017.
